#Dell Inspiron B130 32-bit laptop#

This article is specifically written for my installation of Ubuntu 16.04.1 Server on my Dell Inspiron B130 laptop. My intentions was to create as lightweight of an install for this old 32-bit laptop and gain some more life out of it. I probably could've used something like Arch Linux to make it even more lightweight, but to save time I went with what I knew, Ubuntu.

##Needs##
* Minimal install size
* Lightweight on the resources
* Light GUI interface

##System Resources##
* 32-bit
* 1 GB RAM
* 60 GB HDD
