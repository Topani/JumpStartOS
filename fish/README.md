# Fish shell config files
* I've added here the fish shell configs that I use. I've removed some of the environment variables that are sensitive.
* Note that these are my environment variables and settings related to my system. But they should give a good idea
of what you can do with these config files.
## config.fish
* put this in ~/.config/fish/config.fish
* This config file is run when fish shell is started
* a good location to declare environment variables and functions needed for all shells
## fish_prompt.fish
* put this in ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish
* this config file is run when fish shell is started
* it sets up the prompt you will see in the fish shell
